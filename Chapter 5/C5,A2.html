        Aansu lake, Pakistan - The name "Ansoo" comes from it's tear-like shape (the Urdu word Ansoo means teardrop).
        The Lake also resembles a human eye with a central ice island resembling the iris and a ridge resembling an eyebrow, which 
        becomes even more prominent when ice melts on the "eyebrow" during the summer.
